### [What is this?] (xtUML Days)

This modeling conference is co-located with MODELS and represents the 5th
edition of xtUML Days.  Each successive edition has been bigger and better than
the one before.  (See previous conference editions below.)  xtUML Days is the
most dense gathering of Shlaer-Mellor modelers of the year.  The xtUML
Community meets to collaborate on Modeling, Method and Tooling.

The central topic of the conference is end-to-end modeling, execution,
translation and deployment of models-as-code in mission critical settings
employing rigorous methodology.  The unifying theme is practical, actual,
industrial application modeling within production installations.
Attendees will network with engineers, scientists and educators who
understand executable and translatable modeling as applied in active
systems.

The Shlaer-Mellor Method is applied in varying degrees of integrity in
organizations around the world.

- industrial applications
- Method advances (specifically convergence of Project Technology and Kennedy-Carter dialects
- tooling refinements
- aeronautics, distributed network asset management, medical devices, heavy factory automation

The xtUML Community is keen to exchange expertise and learn from one
another.  xtUML Days provides a forum for developers to share best
practices and influence the direction of the technology.  xtUML Days
hereby solicits compelling papers and presentations that exhibit method
advances, tooling improvements and application experience in Shlaer-Mellor
modeling and related Executable/Translatable modeling.

### Call for Papers

A program committee will review and select from submitted presentations.
Selection is based upon perceived value to the xtUML Community.

Topics of interest to xtUML Days include but are not limited to the following:  
- real-world application modeling examples of installed systems  
- techniques of editing, verifying, translating, debugging and deploying models  
- methodology (Shlaer-Mellor) advances, extensions and refinements  
- static analysis of models and generated code  
- model-based model compilers  
- model integrity  
- action language dialects  
- target software architectures and translation onto those architectures  
- process integration of modeling and modeling tools  
- tooling supporting the Shlaer-Mellor Method  
- state of the art tooling for editing, verifying and translating xtUML models  
- recent experience with tooling and BridgePoint in particular  
- techniques for educating modelers from young children to experienced professionals  
- tooling migration experience reports  

Submit your paper electronically as PDF via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=xtuml2018cop).

All submissions will be evaluated by the program committee.  

Selection is based upon significance, clarity and alignment with the call
and value to the attendees of xtUML Days 2018 Copenhagen.  Submissions
that promote discussion, advance the Method and generate interaction among
xtUML Community members are coveted.  For each a presentation to be
accepted, at least one of the authors must register for xtUML Days,
present the paper and participate in the conference.
