## What is this?

**xtUML Days 2018 Copenhagen** is a modeling conference co-located with
[MODELS](http://www.modelsconference.org/) and represents the 5th edition of
xtUML Days.  Each successive edition has been bigger and better than the one
before.  ([See previous conference editions below](#previous-xtuml-days-editions).)
xtUML Days is the most dense gathering of Shlaer-Mellor modelers of the year.
The xtUML Community meets to collaborate on Modeling, Method and Tooling.

The central topic of the conference is end-to-end modeling, execution,
translation and deployment of models-as-code in mission critical settings
employing rigorous methodology.  The unifying theme is practical, actual,
industrial application modeling within production installations.
Attendees will network with engineers, scientists and educators who
understand executable and translatable modeling as applied in active
systems.

The Shlaer-Mellor Method is applied in varying degrees of integrity in
organizations around the world.  At xtUML Days people from organizations
focused aeronautics, distributed network asset management, medical devices
and heavy factory automation among others will discuss:  

- industrial applications  
- Method advances (specifically convergence of PT and K-C dialects)  
- tooling refinements  

The xtUML Community is keen to exchange expertise and learn from one
another.  xtUML Days provides a forum for developers to share best
practices and influence the direction of the technology.  xtUML Days
hereby solicits compelling papers and presentations that exhibit method
advances, tooling improvements and application experience in Shlaer-Mellor
modeling and related Executable/Translatable modeling.

## Call for Papers

A program committee will review and select from submitted papers, posters
and presentations.  Selection is based upon perceived value to the xtUML
Community.

Topics of interest to xtUML Days include but are not limited to the following:  

- real-world application modeling examples of installed systems  
- techniques of editing, verifying, translating, debugging and deploying models  
- methodology (Shlaer-Mellor) advances, extensions and refinements  
- static analysis of models and generated code  
- model-based model compilers  
- model integrity  
- action language dialects  
- target software architectures and translation onto those architectures  
- process integration of modeling and modeling tools  
- tooling supporting the Shlaer-Mellor Method  
- current state of the art editing, verification, translation, debugging  
- recent experience with tooling and BridgePoint in particular  
- techniques for educating modelers from young children to experienced professionals  
- tooling migration experience reports  

Submit your paper, poster or presentation electronically as PDF via
[EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=xtuml2018cop).
Presentations are expected to be 25-45 minutes in duration including
time for questions and discussion.

All submissions will be evaluated by the program committee.  
Selection is based upon significance, clarity and alignment with the call
and value to the attendees of xtUML Days 2018 Copenhagen.  Submissions
that promote discussion, advance the Method and generate interaction among
xtUML Community members are most desired.  For a presentation to be
accepted, at least one of the authors must register for xtUML Days,
present the material and participate in the conference.

## Important Dates  
Abstract submission deadline:  31 July 2018  
Submission deadline:  31 August 2018  
Author notification:  30 September 2018  
Submission deadline for presentation-ready version:  7 October 2018

### Conference Format
Day 1 of xtUML Days is an information dense and interactive conference
lasting one full day.  The host will welcome attendees at the starting
hour.  The host will make significant introductions.  Key xtUML Community
members will give short updates on their applications and experiences.
Presentations with Q&A and discussions will fill the morning and afternoon
sessions.  An open moderated discussion time will end the day.

A detailed agenda will be available in August upon solidification of the
speaking agenda.

Day 2 of xtUML Days is a planning day for active members of the xtUML
Community.  Planning Day is focused on short and long term requirements of
the Method and road map for tooling.  Day 2 attendance is by invitation only.
