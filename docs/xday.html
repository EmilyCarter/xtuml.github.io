<h2 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h2>
<p><strong>xtUML Days 2018 Copenhagen</strong> is a modeling conference co-located with <a href="http://www.modelsconference.org/">MODELS</a> and represents the 5th edition of xtUML Days. Each successive edition has been bigger and better than the one before. (<a href="#previous-xtuml-days-editions">See previous conference editions below</a>.) xtUML Days is the most dense gathering of Shlaer-Mellor modelers of the year. The xtUML Community meets to collaborate on Modeling, Method and Tooling.</p>
<p>The central topic of the conference is end-to-end modeling, execution, translation and deployment of models-as-code in mission critical settings employing rigorous methodology. The unifying theme is practical, actual, industrial application modeling within production installations. Attendees will network with engineers, scientists and educators who understand executable and translatable modeling as applied in active systems.</p>
<p>The Shlaer-Mellor Method is applied in varying degrees of integrity in organizations around the world. At xtUML Days people from organizations focused on aeronautics, distributed network asset management, medical devices and heavy factory automation among others will discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>industrial applications<br />
</li>
<li>Method advances (specifically convergence of PT and K-C dialects)<br />
</li>
<li>tooling refinements</li>
</ul>
<p>The xtUML Community is keen to exchange expertise and learn from one another. xtUML Days provides a forum for developers to share best practices and influence the direction of the technology. xtUML Days hereby solicits compelling papers and presentations that exhibit method advances, tooling improvements and application experience in Shlaer-Mellor modeling and related Executable/Translatable modeling.</p>
<h2 id="call-for-papers">Call for Papers</h2>
<p>A program committee will review and select from submitted papers, posters and presentations. Selection is based upon perceived value to the xtUML Community.</p>
<p>Topics of interest to xtUML Days include but are not limited to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>real-world application modeling examples of installed systems<br />
</li>
<li>techniques of editing, verifying, translating, debugging and deploying models<br />
</li>
<li>methodology (Shlaer-Mellor) advances, extensions and refinements<br />
</li>
<li>static analysis of models and generated code<br />
</li>
<li>model-based model compilers<br />
</li>
<li>model integrity<br />
</li>
<li>action language dialects<br />
</li>
<li>target software architectures and translation onto those architectures<br />
</li>
<li>process integration of modeling and modeling tools<br />
</li>
<li>tooling supporting the Shlaer-Mellor Method<br />
</li>
<li>current state of the art editing, verification, translation, debugging<br />
</li>
<li>recent experience with tooling and BridgePoint in particular<br />
</li>
<li>techniques for educating modelers from young children to experienced professionals<br />
</li>
<li>tooling migration experience reports</li>
</ul>
<p>Submit your paper, poster or presentation electronically as PDF via <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=xtuml2018cope">EasyChair</a>. (If you are unable to submit through EasyChair, please contact the <a href="#contact">conference chair listed below</a>.) Presentations are expected to be 25-45 minutes in duration including time for questions and discussion.</p>
<p>All submissions will be evaluated by the program committee.<br />
Selection is based upon significance, clarity and alignment with the call and value to the attendees of xtUML Days 2018 Copenhagen. Submissions that promote discussion, advance the Method and generate interaction among xtUML Community members are most desired. For a presentation to be accepted, at least one of the authors must register for xtUML Days, present the material and participate in the conference.</p>

<h3 id="conference-format">Conference Format</h3>
<p>Day 1 of xtUML Days is an information dense and interactive conference lasting one full day. The host will welcome attendees at the starting hour. The host will make significant introductions. Key xtUML Community members will give short updates on their applications and experiences. Presentations with Q&amp;A and discussions will fill the morning and afternoon sessions. An open moderated discussion time will end the day.</p>
<p>A detailed agenda will be available in August upon solidification of the speaking agenda.</p>
<p>Day 2 of xtUML Days is a planning day for active members of the xtUML Community. Planning Day is focused on short and long term requirements of the Method and road map for tooling. Day 2 attendance is by invitation only.</p>
