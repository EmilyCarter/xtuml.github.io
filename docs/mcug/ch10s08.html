    of the create, delete and initialization of class instances.  The
    following paragraphs explain this change and its
    design.  A description of the implementation of the generated code
    follows with an explanation of the effects on speed, space and
    execution.</p><p>MC-3020 3.3 and before has a class-based create, delete, init
    design.  The generated code contains a create accessor, delete
    accessor and factory initializer for each class in the modeled
    system.  When an instance needs to be created, a routine specific
    to the class is invoked to allocate the implementation memory for
    the class instance.  The attributes for the class instance are
    given reasonable default initial values.  Identifying attributes of
    type unique_id are initialized to values certain to be unique with
    the generated system.  The initial state of the new instance state
    machine is set.</p><p>In MC-3020 3.3 and before, when an instance needs to be
    deleted, a routine specific to the class is called to deallocate
    the implementation memory for the instance and perform needed
    clean-up.</p><p>MC-3020 3.3 generates "object factory initialization"
    routines.  There is one of these methods for each class in the
    modeled domains.  These methods are called exactly once at bring-up
    time to initialize the instance memory data pool for the collection
    of instances for the class.  This routine took into consideration
    the fact that some of the instances in a collection may be
    allocated and initialized statically as preexisting instances.
    </p><p>The class-based create/delete/init approach is very flexible.
    It allows the model compiler designer the liberty of considering
    only the class in hand when generating the code.  Different
    profiles of deployment code can be generated based upon the type of
    class (passive, active, associative, having preexisting instances,
    etc).  However, having the create, delete and init accessor
    dispersed to every class is troublesome when considering a
    persistent restore operation from centralized non-volatile storage
    (NVS).</p></div><div class="section" title="Centralized Create/Delete/Init"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="idm269942321648"></a>Centralized Create/Delete/Init</h3></div></div></div><p>MC-3020 3.4 and beyond centralizes the create, delete and
    initialize operations.  This is accomplished by moving the
    intelligence of the class-based create/delete/init procedures into
    a class-based data structure.  This class_info array contains
    information about each class such that centralized operations can
    intelligently create, delete and initialize classes and
    instances.</p><p>The information contained in the class_info structure includes:

    With the above information, it is possible to have centrally
    defined create, delete and initialization routines.  These central
    routines rely on class-specific information from the class_info
    array rather than on class-specific generated procedures.</p></div><div class="section" title="Implications to Persistence Support"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="idm269942309040"></a>Implications to Persistence Support</h3></div></div></div><p>The persistence restore operation relies heavily upon the
    centralized create and initialization routines.  Assuming for a
    moment a system that has no preexisting instances defined in data,
    a system having persistent classes must restore the class instance
    data from a central non-volatile storage unit (NVS).</p><p>When a system powers up, it performs the standard system
    level initialization to bring up event queues and timer support and
    other system level infrastructure.  The system then initializes the
    collection mechanisms for all of the classes in the generated
    system.  This involves linking the instance storage into lists
    (singly or doubly linked).</p><p>At this point in a non-persistence supporting system the
    initialization functions would be invoked to allow application
    level user initialization to occur.  In a persistence supporting
    system, persistent class instances are restored from
    non-volatile storage before the user initialization functions are
    run.</p><p>The process of restoring class instances involves invoking
    the central create routine and populating the newly created
    instance with data from NVS.  The data in the NVS needs to be rich
    enough such that the create routine knows which type of class to
    create.  Once the type is communicated, the class_info array
    provides the necessary details to enable the correct instantiation
    of the new instance.</p></div><div class="section" title="Implementation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="idm269942304192"></a>Implementation</h3></div></div></div><p>In MC-3020 3.3 the files <code class="filename">*_object.c</code>
    contain methods to create, delete and perform factory
    initialization of class instances.  To compare implementations,
    view one of these files in 3.3 generated code.</p><p>In MC-3020 3.4 and beyond, these routines are centralized.
    The class_info structure is
    simply an array of pointers to elements of the structure which
    reside in the individual <code class="filename">*_class.c</code>
    files.</p><p>Each domain is assigned a unique number, and each class
    within a domain is assigned a unique number.  An array of
    class_info arrays exists for the system containing information for
    all classes in all domains.  During translation a domain-unique number
    is assigned to each class.  This number serves as an index into the
    class_info array thus allowing centralized create, delete, init and
    other routines to look up statistics on any class in the
    modeled system.</p></div><div class="section" title="Effects"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="idm269942299712"></a>Effects</h3></div></div></div><p>Centralizing the create, delete and init functions has the
    intended effect of enabling a persistent restore operation that can
    rely on these class-independent routines (namely create).  There
    are positive side-effects of this centralization.</p><p>Code space savings is the primary positive side effect.
    Instead of three routines for each class, there are now three
    routines for the entire system.  This saves substantially on code
    size in the generated system.  This effect will be greatest on
    systems with a large number of classes.</p><p>Other positive side effects include greater flexibility in
    features such as persistence.</p></div><div class="section" title="Cost Modeling"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="idm269942296960"></a>Cost Modeling</h3></div></div></div><p>Persistence services have cost in terms of execution speed,
