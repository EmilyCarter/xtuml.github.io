the xtUML application within multiple tasks or threads.  The tasking
uses the underlying OS/RTOS when one exists.  MC-3020 can still run
without an OS/RTOS, but if preemptive multi-tasking is desired in
the application, it is available.  The tasking/threading
capabilities for MC-3020 are outlined here.</p></div><div class="section" title="Introduction"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="idm60870752864"></a>Introduction</h2></div></div></div><p>A well-modeled xtUML application is inherently concurrent.
  Actions from any two or more instances are considered to run
  simultaneously.  This concurrency at the specification level
  simplifies the task of the developer.  Smaller bits of system can be
  modeled to run somewhat independently.  The life-cycles of classes in
  a system can be modeled mostly independently considering only their
  synchronization with other classes in the system.  For example, the
  microwave door and the turntable run concurrently and mostly without
  recognizing or caring that the other exists or is running.  If
  Developer A is modeling the door, and Developer B is modeling the
  turntable, they can do their state modeling with loose
  coupling.</p><p>To begin using the tasking/threading capability right away,
  jump to <a class="xref" href="ch11s02.html" title="Marking for Tasking">the section called “Marking for Tasking”</a>.</p><p>A form of the inherent concurrency of the xtUML model can
  easily be translated and realized in a single-tasking microcontroller
  target.  In single-tasking mode, MC-3020 interleaves the state
  actions of multiple concurrent instances of executing classes.</p><p>A single-tasking deployment architecture achieves a level of
  concurrency in which state actions from actively running class
  instances are interleaved.  Such a deployment design serves well
  for applications requiring concurrency at the granularity of a
  state action.  It is light weight and fast.</p><p>However, if a finer grained concurrency is desired, it will be
  necessary to use a multi-tasking deployment system.  In a
  multi-tasking deployment environment, state actions can run in
  concurrently executing tasks or threads.  The number of currently
  executing actions can be equal to the number of executing tasks
  (instead of just one).</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch10s08.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch11s02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Persistence Design </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Marking for Tasking</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
