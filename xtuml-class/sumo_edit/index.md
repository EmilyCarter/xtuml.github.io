# xtUML Build-A-Sumo Editing Project

### Editing Assignments

This sequence of assignments involves learning how to edit xtUML models
in BridgePoint.  It goes step-by-step with only a little bit of explanation.
You will learn by _doing_.  When you have completed the project, you will be
more familiar with the tool and how to edit packages, class diagrams and
state machines.

Note that these are _exercises_ only.  Even after the last step the model
is incomplete.  To run the xtUML model, you will need to start with the
complete Sumo model as imported from the xtuml/models repository.

That is the next project!
