# Virtual Machine Homework ![vm](../img/remote_desktop.png)

1) Log into the VM following [these instructions](https://xtuml.github.io/class-prep/).
  * *NOTE: This machine is shared among students and only supports one connection at a 
    time. If you are connected, you will be suddenly disconnected if another user logs in.
    We recommend students coordinate with one another to avoid conflicts.*

2) Take a screenshot of your computer running BridgePoint on the remote desktop.
  * Email the picture to your instructor.
