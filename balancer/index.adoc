= EV3 Balancer Building Instructions

== Background

These instructions describe how to build a balancing robot with a color sensor
for detecting the line and gyro sensor for calculating balance. These
instructions require only parts found in the standard EV3 education core set.

== Congratulations

You have completed your EV3 balancer robot.

A printable template for a paper wrapper for this robot can be found
link:wrapper/wrapper.pdf[here]. When printed on colored card stock, this wrapper
can be used to enable color based visual location tracking of the robot.
