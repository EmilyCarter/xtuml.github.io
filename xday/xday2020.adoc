== What is this?

*xtUML Days 2019 UK* is a modeling conference and represents the 6th
edition of xtUML Days.  (See <<Previous xtUML Days>>.)
xtUML Days is the most dense gathering of Shlaer-Mellor modelers of the year.
The xtUML Community meets to collaborate on Modeling, Method and Tooling.

The central topic of the conference is end-to-end modeling, execution,
translation and deployment of models-as-code in mission critical settings
employing rigorous methodology.  The unifying theme is practical, actual,
industrial application modeling within production installations.
Attendees will network with engineers, scientists and educators who
understand executable and translatable modeling as applied in active
systems.  In 2019, a special focus will be applied to extending and
clarifying the Shlaer-Mellor Method in light of undocumented developments
over the last several years.

The Shlaer-Mellor Method is applied in varying degrees of integrity in
organizations around the world.  At xtUML Days people from organizations
focused on aeronautics, distributed network asset management, medical devices
and heavy factory automation among others will discuss:  

* Method advances (specifically convergence of PT and K-C dialects)  
* Standardized Architecture environments such as ECOA, FACE, AUTOSAR and
  safety standards such as ISO 26262 and IEC 60601
* Model of Communication
* Constraint Modeling
* Cryptographic Architecture
* Tooling Refinements  

The xtUML Community is keen to exchange expertise and learn from one
another.  xtUML Days provides a forum for developers to share best
practices and influence the direction of the technology.  xtUML Days
hereby solicits compelling papers and presentations that exhibit method
advances, tooling improvements and application experience in Shlaer-Mellor
modeling and related Executable/Translatable modeling.
This year attendees represent One Fact, UK Crown, BAE Systems, ROGO,
Northrop Grumman, Aurora Consulting, Software Improvements, L3, Thales,
Toyo Corporation, ICS, FrogOOA, Kyushu University, University of Southampton
and Jönköping University.

=== Keynote Speaker

The xtUML Days 2019 UK keynote speaker is Takao Futagami.  He is a chief
consultant at Toyo Corporation.  His research interests focus on embedded
systems engineering.  Futagami-sensei holds a degree in physics from Tsukuba
University and is a professor at Tokai University.

Mr. Futagami was instrumental to the introduction of the Shlaer-Mellor Method,
xtUML and associated tooling into Japan in the 1990s and continues to promote
modeling in industry and education.  Futagami has helped translate much of the
Shlaer-Mellor literature into Japanese.

Shlaer-Mellor Material:

* _Executable UML: A Foundation for Model-Driven Architecture_, Stephen Mellor and Marc Balcer
* _MDA Distilled_, Stephen Mellor and Kendall Scott
* _How to Build Shlaer-Mellor Object Models_, Leon Starr
* _Executable UML How to Build Class Models_, Leon Starr

Programming and C:

* _Programing LEGO Mindstorms_, Brian Bagnall
* _MISRA-C Coding Guideline 1997_
* _MISRA-C Coding Guideline 2004_
